# practice
My initial test for learning JS, HTML, CSS
It's important to use GIT so that I can code on multiple machines. Because I'm always on the go. Whirlwind world traveller and such. I'm not lying. 

And now I'm testing to see if local changes can be updated to github. At least I'm not trying any branching stuff yet...
