Referring to the other users by closeList[i] (AKA index #), then we'll run into real trouble when a user gets popped from the list. Unless we updated closeList and re-rendered the page every time that it was interacted w/. That would take care of reassigning the proper functions to the onclick()s of the submit buttons.
Every time we split/slice/whatever a user from the closeList[], if we just rerender all the page-entries instead of just the one paragraph, then it should work.
